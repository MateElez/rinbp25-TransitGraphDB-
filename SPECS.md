# Public Transportation Planning Tool - Specifications

## Overview
The Public Transportation Planning Tool is designed to help users optimize public transport routes and schedules. It leverages **MongoDB** for storing transit schedules and **Neo4j** for analyzing and optimizing routes using graph algorithms like **shortest path** and **traveling salesman problem (TSP)**.

## Objectives and Key Features
### Objectives
- Provide an efficient way to plan public transport routes.
- Optimize travel paths using advanced graph algorithms.
- Store and manage transit schedules reliably.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for route planning.

### Key Features
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores schedules and transit stop data.
- **Neo4j Graph Processing**: Calculates shortest paths and optimized routes.
- **REST API**: Provides endpoints for fetching schedules and routes.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Enables users to plan their trips.
- **Secure Access**: Implements authentication and authorization for API access.

## System Architecture
### Components
1. **MongoDB**: Stores transit schedules and stop locations.
2. **Neo4j**: Processes route optimization using graph algorithms.
3. **Backend (Node.js/Python/Java)**: Handles API requests and processes data.
4. **Frontend (React/Vue)**: Provides an interface for users to plan routes.

### Data Flow
1. User requests a route through the frontend.
2. The backend fetches schedule data from **MongoDB**.
3. The backend queries **Neo4j** to compute the optimal route.
4. The result is sent back to the frontend for display.

## Functional Requirements
- Users can **search transit schedules** by location.
- The system calculates the **shortest route** between two stops.
- Users can request an optimized **multi-stop trip** using TSP.
- The API provides **real-time route information**.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Supports large transit networks.
- **Performance**: Fast response times for route calculations.
- **Security**: Implements authentication and secure data storage.
- **Availability**: Ensures high uptime and reliability.

## Conclusion
The Public Transportation Planning Tool combines **MongoDB** and **Neo4j** to provide an efficient and optimized route-planning system. With a focus on usability, security, and scalability, the system offers an effective solution for public transit users and operators.
